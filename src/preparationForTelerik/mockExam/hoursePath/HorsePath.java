/**
 * Created by Lenny on 11/18/2018.
 * You know the horse Koci? He likes to iterate matrices.

 Since he wants to be more than a regular horse, he iterates the matrices using the moves of the knights in chess as follows:

 At each turn, he can jump to one of the 8 horse moves. He tries to jump to the topmost, leftmost cell of of these cells.
 If all the 8 positions are taken (he already jumped there), he restarts him jumping from the leftmost, topmost free cell
 At each turn he leaves a number, to indicate he has been there.
 By given the size of the matrix, print the cells of Koci.

 Input
 Read from the standard input

 On the single line of the input, find the number N
 The size of the matrix
 Output
 Print to the standard output

 On N lines, print N cells with the numbers of Koci's iteration
